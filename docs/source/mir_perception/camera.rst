RealSense2 camera
------------------

How to use the RealSense2 camera

1. Installation

  Go to the intel-ros github page. Clone the realsense repository in your catkin workspace inside src:

  .. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:intel-ros/realsense.git

2. Camera Output

  Run the following to get access to the camera:

  .. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch

  Open rviz to visualize the camera output.

3. Configure camera output (OPTIONAL)

  Run the following to open the rviz configuration window:

  .. code-block:: bash

    rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

  You can also try to change the "octree_resolution" value:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd *catkin workspace*/src/mas_perception/mcr_scene_segmentation/ros/config
    gedit scene_segmentation_constraints.yaml

4. Setup Base Frame

  Run the following:

  .. code-block:: bash

    rosrun tf static_transform_publisher x y z roll pitch yaw base_link camera_link 100

  where x, y, z are the distances and roll, pitch, yaw are the rotations from the base_link to the camera_link.

  To visualize your frames in rzviz, add the TF feature in the rviz menu.

5. Save Point Clouds

  If it's your first time saving point clouds, you need to choose where you want to save them and enable data collection:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd *catkin workspace*/src/mas_perception/mcr_scene_segmentation/ros/launch
    gedit scene_segmentation.launch

  Change the value of "dataset_collection" from "false" to "true". Change value of "logdir" from "/temp/ 
  to the path in your computer where you want to save the files.

  Run the following to get access to the point clouds given by the camera:

  .. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch mcr_scene_segmentation scene_segmentation.launch input_pointcloud_topic:=/camera/depth_registered/points

  Publish the message 'e-start':

  .. code-block:: bash
  
    rostopic pub /mcr_perception/scene_segmentation/event_in std_msgs/String "data: 'e_start'"

  Publish the message 'e-add-cloud-start':

  .. code-block:: bash
  
    rostopic pub /mcr_perception/scene_segmentation/event_in std_msgs/String "data: 'e_add_cloud_start'"

  This last one will save the current point cloud of the observed object in your system.

  .. warning::
  
    Sometimes the camera won't save the point cloud (don't worry, not your fault). 
    Just try a different position for the object until it works.

6. Visualize Point Cloud

  Run the following in the folder where you saved the point clouds:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pcl_viewer *.pcd file you want to open*
