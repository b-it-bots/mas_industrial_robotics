Refbox parser
=============

This node contains components to store the world model of the environment and the goal of the tasks in the knowledge base of the robot.
World model is defined as the locations and properties of different moveable
objects(eg: robot, box etc) in the environment.
The world model node has to subscribe to the incoming data stream which informs
of the current state of the world.(Eg : Refree box)
It then has to store this value in the any format which can be utilized for 
other components.
