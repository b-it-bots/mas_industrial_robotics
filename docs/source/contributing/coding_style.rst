Coding style
=============

.. note::

  Make sure that your text editor is properly configured to use **spaces** instead of tabs.


C/C++
-----

* Filenames

  Filenames should be all lowercase and words are separated by underscores \( \_ \). For instance:

  .. code-block:: bash

    whole_body_controller.cpp
    whole_body_controller.h

* Class names

  Class names should be nouns in `UpperCamelCase <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Camel_case>`_, 
  i.e. the first letter of every word capitalised. Use whole words and avoid acronyms or 
  abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as SVM or ROS).

* Function names

  Regular functions have mixed case. The first word (which is usually a verb) starts 
  with lowercase and the remaining words follow the `CamelCase <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Camel_case>`_ practice. 
  For instance:

  .. code-block:: cpp
    
    getEuclideanDistance2d ( double x1 , double y1 , double x2 , double y2 )

* Variable Names

  Variable names are all lowercase, with underscores between words. Class member 
  variables have trailing underscores. For instance:

  .. code-block:: cpp

    double current_velocity_joint_1 = 0 . 0 ; // non member class variable
    double current_velocity_joint_1_ = 0 . 0 ; // member class variable
